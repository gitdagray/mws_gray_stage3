# Restaurants Project - Stage 3

### Notes on Development Environment
- Serve web app pages with the Python server.
- The server repository mentioned below is a Node server that provides the data endpoints.
- During development, both the Python and Node servers can run in separate CLI windows.

## Steps to complete
#### 1. Fork and clone the server repository. Youâ€™ll use this development server to develop your project code.
Server repository found here:
```
https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3
```
#### 2. Add a form to allow users to submit their own reviews.
#### 3. Add functionality to defer submission of the form until connection is re-established.
#### 4. Follow the recommendations provided by Lighthouse to achieve the required performance targets.
Performance, PWA, and Accessiblity scores above 90
#### 5. Submit your project code for review.

## Getting Started

### Development local API Server
_Location of server = /server_
Server depends on [node.js LTS Version: v6.11.2 ](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), and [sails.js](http://sailsjs.com/)
Please make sure you have these installed before proceeding forward.

Great, you are ready to proceed forward; awesome!

Let's start with running commands in your terminal, known as command line interface (CLI)

###### Install project dependancies
```Install project dependancies
# npm i
```
###### Install Sails.js globally
```Install sails global
# npm i sails -g
```
###### Start the server
```Start server
# node server
```
### You should now have access to your API server environment
debug: Environment : development
debug: Port        : 1337
